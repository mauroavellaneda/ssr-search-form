This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. The primary goal of this project is to implement a server-side search bar using Next.js's App Router and Server Actions for efficient, secure, and scalable search functionality.

This project focuses on building a server-side search bar that processes user queries on the server, retrieves relevant results, and displays them dynamically.

The search bar leverages Next.js Server Actions to handle queries without relying on client-side JavaScript, ensuring better security, performance, and SEO compatibility. The application is designed to be accessible, responsive, and optimized for production deployment.
